- 👋 Hi, I’m @Sh4duwu (actually Sh4duw#9247, but it was taken)
- 👀 I’m interested in gaming (FPS + racing), 3D-modelling / -animating, architecture and engineering.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning in high school, senior year.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate only on projects with people I know personally for the first year, in the future the filtering will become more lenient.
- 📫 How to reach me ... it'll be tough, but Discord is a possibility. My DM-s are open, so please don't add me. Lack of mutual servers means You'll get removed without a second thought.


Sh4duwu/Sh4duwu is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` appears on my GitHub profile, not yours or anywhere else.
